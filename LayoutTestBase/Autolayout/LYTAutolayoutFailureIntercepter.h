/**
 This class intercepts autolayout failures. It's useful for testing to ensure that we don't break any constraints.
 
 It should NOT ever be used in prod. This is because it relies on Apple's private methods which is brittle. Your app will also possibly be rejected 
 from the App Store because of using private APIs.
 It swizzles a private method on a private class (NSISEngine) and runs a block whenever this method is run. This method always gets run when there 
 is a layout failure (handleUnsatisfiableRowWithHead:body:usingInfeasibilityHandlingBehavior:mutuallyExclusiveConstraints:).
 
 If Apple updates their implementation, this class will need to be changed.
