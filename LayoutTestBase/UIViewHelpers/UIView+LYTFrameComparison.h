 Returns whether a view is before another view on the horizontal axis. It returns false if they are overlapping in any way.
 It uses [UIApplication sharedApplication].userInterfaceLayoutDirection to determine what before means. If we are in a right-to-left language (such as 
 Arabic), then before means it must be on the right hand side. Therefore, you can use this to verify your right-to-left behavior.
 
 It uses an epsilon value for float comparison defined in LYTConfig.
