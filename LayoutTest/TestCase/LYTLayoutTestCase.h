/**
 This class defines a basic XCTestCase subclass which implements multiple layout test helpers. It's recommended that your layout tests subclass this class.
 
 The basic test will just call one of the methods starting with runLayoutTestsWithViewProvider:. The rest of the class provides helpers to configure 
 your tests futher.
 
 Subclassing Notes
 
 It's also recommended that you create your own subclass of this for your own project, and have all your other tests subclass this class. This allows you to
 add and remove features in the future. There is a category which lists some methods you may want to consider overriding.

/**
 If you have a view which purposefully overlaps another view, you can add that view to this set to avoid failing the test. You should do this in the 
 validation block of runLayoutTestsWithViewProvider:validation:. Adding a view to this set will avoid failures for overlapping a sibling view and 
 being out of bounds of the parent view.
 
 This is reset on every iteration of the tests, so you must keep adding views in the validation block.
 
 One example is having a background image view which you know will overlap with many other views. In this case, you should only add the background
 image view to this set (and not the other overlapping views).

 This is the main method that runs your tests. You pass in a class that conforms to LYTViewProvider and it will run multiple combinations

 It also runs a few tests automatically:
 
 - Tests that that no sibling subviews are overlapping.
 - Tests that that no subview is out of the bounds of its parent view.
 - Tests that that autolayout is not ambiguous.
 - Tests that autolayout doesn't throw any errors.
 - Performs some accessibility sanity checks.
   - Verifies that all UIControl elements have an accessibilityLabel.
   - Verifies that no accessibility elements are nested (otherwise they aren't available to accessibility users).
   - Verifies that all views with accessibility identifiers have accessibility labels. If a view has an identifier and does not have a label, voice 
 over will read out the identifier to the user.
